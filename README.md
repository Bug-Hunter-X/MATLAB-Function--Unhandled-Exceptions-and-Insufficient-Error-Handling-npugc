This repository contains a MATLAB function with potential issues related to unhandled exceptions and insufficient error handling. The function `myFunction.m` demonstrates a scenario where negative inputs will trigger an error, however, other cases which might result in unexpected behavior or silent failures are not covered. The file `bugSolution.m` provides a more robust version of the function with improved error handling and input validation.
